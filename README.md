Code and PPT at the release.

This system proposed an intelligent optimal scheduling and shipment   solution, which based on the shipment task in real container terminals. Using IOT and cloud platform technology, this system simulated and optimized the transport process of an intelligent terminal. And three collaborative optimization control links are included in this system: AGV, terminal gantry crane and terminal bridge crane, which obviously improved the container transport efficiency and reduced the storage costs. Meanwhile, intelligent logistics system greatly saved the labor costs in terminals and reduced the incidence of accidents caused by the human factors.
